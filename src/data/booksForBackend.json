Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.",

Dr Ali Abdaal - the world`s most-followed productivity expert - has uncovered an easier, happier path to success. Drawing on decades of psychological research, he has found that the secret to productivity and success isn`t grind - it`s feeling good. If you can make your work feel good, then productivity takes care of itself. In this revolutionary book, Ali reveals how the science of feel-good productivity can transform your life. He introduces the three hidden `energisers` that underpin enjoyable productivity, the three `blockers` we must overcome to beat procrastination, and the three `sustainers` that prevent burnout and help us achieve lasting fulfilment. He recounts the inspiring stories of founders, Olympians, and Nobel-winning scientists who embody the principles of Feel-Good Productivity. And he introduces the simple, actionable changes that you can use to achieve more and live better, starting today.",

    "description": "In Using and analysing data in Australian schools, Selena Fisk brings her experience as a classroom teacher and school leader to demonstrate how understanding and using data effectively can not only change the way you see your students, but how they see themselves as learners. This practical guide will show you how to bring all those letters and numbers to life, and create a classroom culture where quality feedback, growth mindsets and principles of positive psychology can work together to transform the lowest achievers into rising stars, and where a whole-school approach to monitoring achievement can ensure that every student’s progress remains on track for continued success. This resource is packed with specific, classroom-tested strategies and tips for implementing them in any classroom, featuring real examples taken from common data sources such as NAPLAN bands, stanines and GPAs. Steps for developing data protocols, facilitating data-informed conversations and conducting teacher-team discussions are also included, as well as customisable templates that every teacher can use as they set out on their own data journey.",

    "title": "Thought Flights",
    "author": "Professor Robert Musil",
    "description": "Robert Musil`s Thought Flights vividly evokes the secrets, challenges, and mundanities of interwar life in cosmopolitan Vienna and Berlin. The texts presented here have been selected by translator Genese Grill from Musil`s Nachlass and collected for the first time under the title Thought Flights. They include material originally published in journals, newspapers, and magazines - but not included in Musil`s Posthumous Papers of a Living Author - as well as literary fragments and heretofore unpublished texts. Despite the temporal, geographical, and cultural distance between Musil`s world and ours, our own time and troubles are all too recognizable in Musil`s portrayals of the `age of money,` of simulation, and of standardization. Thought Flights is a lament of contemporary complacency, optimism, and homogenization as well as a celebration of living words and original thought by one of the great Modernists of the 20th century. As an astonishing master of metaphor and self-described `Monsieur le Vivisecteur,` Musil explores the psyches and lives of himself and his contemporaries with illuminating insight. The lucid, striking prose of his stories and vignettes, and the wise and witty commentary of his glosses, show Musil`s response to innovations in technology, art, and politics, and his efforts to enact a strategy for both illuminating and ameliorating the crisis of language that haunted his contemporaries. Moving effortlessly from discussion of fashion to Kant`s categorical imperative, le vivisecteur writes with humor, lyricism, and fervor in an open genre availing itself of poetic prose, philosophical essay, fictional narrative, and feuilletonistic lightness. Through unlikely combinations and metaphoric syntheses, Musil brings `beauty and excitement` into the world, and when things that are usually separate unite, thoughts `fly.` With this publication, the now growing English-language corpus of the author of The Confusions of Young Torless, Five Women, and The Man without Qualities is expanded further. Other volumes of Musil`s writings will be forthcoming from Contra Mundum Press over the next decade.",

    "description": "New York/Newark: Barse & Co.. Near Fine in Very Good+ dj. (c.1931). First Edition. Hardcover. (price-clipped) [a lightly-worn book, with a minor bump to the top rear corner and some slight dust-soiling to the top edge; jacket is bright and colorful, with some very minor paper loss at spine ends (no loss of text), some internal dampstaining to the rear panel with only negligible effect to the exterior]. (frontispiece photo of Gertrude Berg) The Rise of the Goldbergs (the title was eventually shortened to simply The Goldbergs) debuted as a 15-minute weekly program on NBC radio in November of 1929, and was an immediate hit. The show became a daily broadcast in 1931, the same year this book appeared, and by which time (per the book`s introduction) NBC had received so many requests .... for copies of the episodes that it has been found advisable to publish the first volume with subsequent volumes to follow. (Essentially, then, these are radio scripts rendered into short-story form.) The radio series ran through 1946 and was subsequently adapted for both Broadway (Molly and Me) and as an early TV series -- but interestingly, although the intro to this book even mentions numerous offers...from moving picture producers, they didn`t get around to making a Goldbergs movie until 1950. (One can easily imagine Samuel Goldwyn sagely declaring the property too Jewish!) The colorful dustjacket, with a cartoon illustration of the Berg clan, is a genuine rarity.",

While Antenor is busy congratulating himself on his excellent catch, Euridice spends her humdrum days ironing his shirts and removing the lumps of onion from his food, dreaming of the success she could have made of herself – as a writer, dressmaker or culinary whizz – in another life. Her free-spirited sister Guida, on the other hand, is the kind of person who was born knowing everything. When she returns from her failed elopement with stories of heartbreak and loss, the lives of Euridice and her husband are thrown into confusion, with disastrous consequences. The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao is a darkly comic debut, bursting with vibrant Brazilian spirit and unforgettable characters – a jubilant novel about the emancipation of women.",

    "description": "Boston: Little, Brown and Company. Near Fine in Near Fine dj. 1934. First Edition. Hardcover. [very nice copy, light shelfwear, a trace of foxing on fore-edge, bookplate on front pastedown; the jacket is remarkably clean and well-preserved, with some minor wear along the top and bottom edges, slight browning to spine, and one tiny nick mid-spine]. A beautiful copy of the author`s first book, SIGNED by him directly beneath his printed signature on the title page, and just above one of illustrator Robert Lawson`s drawings of the title character. Haines began working as a telephone lineman during summer vacations while in college (University of Pennsylvania), and took on the work full-time upon his graduation in 1931. His experiences on that job provided fodder for his literary efforts, including his first published short stories and two novels, this one and the subsequent High Tension in 1937. Time Magazine said of this novel that in celebrating his craft and the men who pursue it, [the author] has not overlooked the fact that novel writing is also a craft in itself. He has mastered the new calling as thoroughly as his hero, Slim, mastered the job of wire stringing. The tale is by turns hard-boiled, sentimental, tragic, humorous. But the toughness, the sentiment, the tragedy and the humor all belong to a man`s world. The success of Slim put Haines on the path to Hollywood -- Warner Bros. bought the novel and hired him to write the adaptation (the film, starring Henry Fonda, was released in 1937), and he stuck around and wrote a dozen or so screenplays over the next 25 years. (Notable credits were BLACK LEGION, THE TEXANS, and THE WINGS OF EAGLES; the 1948 film COMMAND DECISION was based on his novel and play.) I suspect this novel has a cult following among telephone linemen and/or collectors of memorabilia related thereto -- in fact, at one point on there was even a line of Slim t-shirts reproducing one of the wonderful Lawson decorations that are sprinkled throughout the text.

When Alex is captured and convicted of murder following a brutal attack on an elderly woman, he is given the option to undergo a new experimental psychological technique which will aim to instil a deep aversion to violence in him. Through Alex’s story, A Clockwork Orange explores themes including free will and the duality of good and evil. As well as its vivid descriptions of violence, the novella is notable for its used of Nadsat, a Russian-influenced argot invented by Burgess (who was also a linguist).",
